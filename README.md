# UNP_PROJECT_BI_WITH_MS_EXCEL_EMPLOYEE_PERSONNEL_DATA

I created an Excel Dashboard using employee personnel data to analyze demographic, financial, educational, and additional details of individuals in collaboration with http://www.unp.education. where It includes interactive charts,filters and summary tables.Key insights reveal income concentration in the 100000â€“170000 range, mixed car ownership, and prevalent secondary education. Employment patterns, gender trends, and family structures offer further analytical opportunities.A significant portion of the population is currently employed, as indicated by negative values in the DAYS_EMPLOYED field.Higher income levels tend to correlate with more stable employment and specific occupations.Individuals with higher education often report higher incomes, though this trend can vary by occupation.Car ownership appears more common among those with real estate, suggesting a potential link between assets.Gender-based income disparities and job roles could be explored to uncover societal patterns.Marital status, especially being married, often correlates with larger family sizes.Younger individuals (based on age range) tend to have fewer children and lower income levels.With a user-friendly layout,the dashboard enhances data-driven decision making for understanding and analyze employee personnel data.
